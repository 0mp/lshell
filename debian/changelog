lshell (0.9.0) unstable; urgency=low

    * added support for UNIX groups in configuration file

      check_secure and check_path functions
    * redirections are forbidden by default (in the configuration file)
    * added flexible +/- possibilities in configuration file
    * now supports completion after '|', ';' and '&'

      as forbidden, as warning counter is decreased.
